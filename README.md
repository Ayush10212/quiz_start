# ðŸ§  True/False Quiz Game (Python)

A simple **True/False quiz game** built in Python using **OOP principles**.  
Questions are stored in a separate `data.py` file and turned into `Question` objects, which are then used by the `QuizBrain` class to run the game.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Text-based True/False quiz in the terminal.
- Score tracking after every question.
- Case-insensitive input (`True/False` or `T/F`).
- Easy to extend â€” just add more questions in `data.py`.
- Clean structure following **Object-Oriented Programming**.
